In this case, you should rely on your Microsoft Office account and not a product key in order to install and utilize applications such as Office and other individually bought applications like Project, Visio, Outlook, Excel, and Word. 

Keep in mind that if you purchased a new and unused Office 365 product key card in order to either renew an Office 365 subscription or buy your trial, you are able to enter that product key if Office asks you to provide it. 

However, there are a couple of exceptions where you will do something more than just signing in. 

If you have purchased Office Professional Plus, Visio Professional or Project Professional through your employerâ€™s Microsoft HUP benefit, then you will need your product key in order to install Office onto a PC. 
You will need to contact your admin if you are using a volume license version of Office Professional Plus at your job. 
If you can see either a yellow or red band that says Subscription Expired, then you will need to renew your Office 365 subscription in order for you to be able to keep using Office.
If Office came already installed on your newly purchased device, and you see either a yellow or red banner that says Product Notice: Most of the features of the applications have been disabled because they have not been activated, then you must start a new Office 365 Home trial, sign in with a Microsoft account that is already associated with Office, or purchase Office.office.com/setup or microsoft.com
